This is a fitness app made to track ~~my~~ our gains at the gym.

### Running the backend

Backend's built on node.js with typescript, and graphql. All you gotta do is:
1. cd into the ./backend directory of the project
2. yarn/npm install
3. yarn build:watch to run the server AND watch over changes / auto compile and stuff

### Running the frontend

Frontend's built with React, basically do 1 and 2 from the backend and then:
3. yarn start

Oh yeah, and have MongoDB installed.
